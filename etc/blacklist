# This is sboui's blacklist file. It operates on package names as well as any
# SlackBuild name in the repo. sboui will not install, remove, upgrade, or
# reinstall any package or SlackBuild listed here.
 
# Example blacklisting by name:
#avl
#vlc
#i3
 
# You can blacklist using regular expressions
#
# You don't need to use the full regex here, because all of the following
# will be checked for the regex: name, version, arch, build, and full package
# name.
#
# This one will blacklist all Alien Bob packages
#[0-9]+alien
#
# This would blacklist all of the SlackBuilds.org packages
#[0-9]_SBo
#
# This one would blacklist anything with "flash" in the name
#(.*)flash(.*)
